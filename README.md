# Upskill2022
**This is a personal playgroud where I discover knowledge gaps and level up!**

Because for about 9 years I have learnt plenty while shipping products with teams using various languages and framwrorks including; Angular, React, Drupal CMS, WordPress, CoreMedia and sometimes basic HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(ES 5,6). Learning while working on projects is how I _survived_ ... yes, _survived_, even though from their own feedback I am assured that clients, colleageus and bosses loved my work ethic. 

I say _survived_ because this way of learning is unsustainable. It left me with huge knowledge gaps which affected my quality of code, flow of logic, turn-around-time, quality of code reviews, general contributions to teams I work with. Worst of all, it compounds to some measure of that imposter syndrome we devs know too well.

I am committing to cover everything from basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript to more senior-level stuff, guided by resources from the web such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla Development Network" target="_blank">Mozilla Development Network (MDN)</a> and <a href="https://courses.webdevsimplified.com" title="Web Dev Simplified" target="_blank">Web Dev Simplified</a> just to mention a few.
