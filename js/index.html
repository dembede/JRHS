  <h2>first steps - the guessing game</h2>
  <strong>The assignment reads:</strong>
  <blockquote>
    I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then
    challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn the player should be told if they are right or
    wrong, and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what numbers
    they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When
    the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.
  </blockquote>
  <section class="game">
    <p>We have selected a random number between 1 and 100. See if you can guess it in 10 turns or fewer. We'll tell you
      if
      your guess was too high or too low.</p>

    <div class="form">
      <label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label>
      <input type="text" id="guessField" class="guessField">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit">
    </div>

    <div class="resultParas">
      <p class="guesses"></p>
      <p class="lastResult"></p>
      <p class="lowOrHi"></p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <p>This incorporates learning about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>functions</b> — e.g. <code>checkGuess()</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>operators</b> — they allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.
      <ul>
        <li>
          arithmetic operators — <code>+ - * /</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          comparison operators — <code>=== != &lt; &gt; </code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>conditionals</b> — see the <code>checkGuess() { ... }</code> function in <code>script.js</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>events</b> — would look something like <code>guessSubmit.addEventListener('click', checkGuess);</code>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>storing information - variables</h3>
  <p>Using <code>var</code> had its advantages <i>e.g. variable hoisting - where variables can be initialised before
      being declared</i>, but its disadvantages surpass those
    suffered by <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.</p>
  <p>As a principle, use <code>const</code> when you can, and only use <code>let</code> when you have to.</p>
  <h5>naming conventions</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Always better to stick to <code>camelCase</code> </li>
    <li>Don't use underscores before as a prefix - these are reserved for other JS functions</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>variable types</h5>
  <p>
    JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to
    specify
    what data type a variable will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc).
  </p>
  <p><strong>Arrays : </strong> an object with multiple values separated by commas. <a
