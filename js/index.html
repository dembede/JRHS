  <h2>first steps - the guessing game</h2>
  <strong>The assignment reads:</strong>
  <blockquote>
    I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then
    challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn the player should be told if they are right or
    wrong, and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what numbers
    they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When
    the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.
  </blockquote>
  <section class="game">
    <p>We have selected a random number between 1 and 100. See if you can guess it in 10 turns or fewer. We'll tell you
      if
      your guess was too high or too low.</p>

    <div class="form">
      <label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label>

  <p>This incorporates learning about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>functions</b> — e.g. <code>checkGuess()</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>operators</b> — they allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.
      <ul>
        <li>
          arithmetic operators — <code>+ - * /</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          comparison operators — <code>=== != &lt; &gt; </code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>conditionals</b> —
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>events</b> —
    </li>
  </ul>
